              Hello! I am Oscar and I am a Graphic Designer looking to expand his skills to become an awesome software developer. 
              I am currently styding at Thinkful and I cannot wait to see show my portfolio-worthy projects in the near future. 
              I am located in the state of New Hampshire and I hope to move in somewhere warmer in the future!

          <h3 class="text header-text-2"> About Me</h2>
          <p class="text">
            My passion for software engineering comes mostly from the rewarding feeling of being given the task of having a given 
            idea/'s and making it/them come to life by thinking out of the box and problem solving. It is especially rewarding when 
            working with a team as I not only get to learn other's coding styles & helpful tips but I also get to discuss and work 
            together while molding an awesome project. It's like baking a tasty treat with a friend and eating it together afterwards. 
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Aside from coding & learning about it, I love art in general and looking at it and thinking "how did that get made?". 
            It makes me look at the world in an interesting perspective. 
          </p>
          <p class="text"> Also from looking at art, my other interests include:</p>
